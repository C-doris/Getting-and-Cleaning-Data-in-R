Getting and Cleaning Data Course in R Project  (JGH)

A repository created by Doris C. Obodoefuna as a final project for Getting and Cleaning Data course. It includes procedures to carry out analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset. 
Dataset: Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones.

Files includes a CodeBook.md illustrates the variables, the data, and procedures for cleaning the data used; The run_analysis.R shows the data preprocessing and processing steps as listed  in the course projectâ€™s requirement, as follows:
An R script that
          1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
          2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
          3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
          4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
          5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
